Time-series model (LSTM) to predict sepsis dynamically, using a small core set of vital signs, and output risk probabilities. 

1. Core Features

5 time-series features — usually for sepsis prediction these are:

Heart Rate (HR)

Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)

Respiratory Rate (RR)

Temperature (Temp)

Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂)

These are collected hourly or per minute.


2. Preprocessing

Resample: Ensure all time series are uniform (e.g., 1-hour intervals).

Missing values: Impute missing vitals with forward-fill or median values.

Normalize: Scale each feature (MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler) so LSTM/GRU learns effectively.

Sequence creation: Use a sliding window of, e.g., 10 hours to predict the next hour's risk.


3. Postprocessing & Thresholding

Default threshold for classifying sepsis: 0.5.

But WE tune based on risk tolerance:

risk = model.predict(new_data)  # returns probability
if risk > 0.8:
    print("Septic shock likely")
elif risk > 0.5:
    print("Sepsis likely")
else:
    print("Low risk")




MODEL INFO
The model accepts  a 3d array of input data as it was trained similarly. 
This data shows progression of a single patient in 10 intervals with 5 features.
This gives the model a [10,5] structure.


# Example: last 10 hours of vitals for a patient
# Replace these with real measurements
patient_sequence = np.array([
    [82, 118, 16, 37.1, 97],  # Hour 1
    [85, 115, 17, 37.3, 96],
    [88, 112, 18, 37.5, 95],
    [90, 110, 19, 37.6, 94],
    [92, 108, 20, 37.8, 93],
    [95, 105, 21, 38.0, 92],
    [97, 102, 22, 38.2, 91],
    [100, 100, 23, 38.5, 90],
    [102, 98, 24, 38.7, 89],
    [105, 95, 25, 39.0, 88]
])  # shape: (10,5)


Each Set of vitals represents an hourly result of a single patient.
